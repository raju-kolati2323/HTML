DRF started in 1996 with the mission to educate and skill young people to fast track them towards better livelihood options. Early programs focused on children’s education and skill development among young people from lower income households. The foundation established a school and vocational college to provide affordable quality education. Other education interventions include collaborating to improve learning outcomes and infrastructure in under-resourced government schools and establishment of an Education Resource Centre to meet the changing academic and pedagogical requirements. On the skill development front our Livelihood Advancement Business School, better known as LABS, was among the first short-term employment linked training programs in India.
